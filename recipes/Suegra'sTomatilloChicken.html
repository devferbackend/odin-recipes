    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Chicken pieces are seared and then simmered in a tomatillo sauce. This is my mother in law's recipe from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico," says recipe creator Cyber Pana.</p> 
    <p>"Serve with warm tortillas and your choice of rice or beans as a side. We recommend a cold cola pop to accompany your delicious meal."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
        <li>3 dried red chile peppers</li>
        <li>2 dried California chile pods</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place tomatillos, red chile peppers, and California chile pods in a small roasting pan or a rimmed baking sheet; roast for about 20 minutes, turning frequently. If chilies start to get too dark, transfer to a food processor or blender.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces; cook, turning to sear evenly on all sides.</li>
        <li>Combine tomatillos and chilies in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Season with salt; add to skillet with chicken. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until chicken is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        
    </ol>
